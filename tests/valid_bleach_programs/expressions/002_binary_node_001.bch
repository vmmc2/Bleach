// This test is responsible for checking whether the 'Binary' node is correctly functioning.
// Here we check each of the binary operators available in Bleach and their behavior depending on the operands.

// Binary Arithmetic Operators when both operands are of type 'num'.

print 3.14 + 2.71;

print 3 - 4;
print 3.14 - 2.71;

print 3 * 4;
print 3.14 * 2.71;

print 3 / 4;
print 3.14 / 2.71;

print 3 % 4;
print 3.14 % 2.71;


// Binary Arithmetic Operators when both operands are of type 'str'.
print "hello," + " world!";


// Binary Arithmetic Operators when both operands are of type 'list'.
print [1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6];


// Binary Arithmetic Operators when one operand is of type 'num' and the other is of type 'str'.
print "Hello " + 42;

print 42 + " Hello";


// Binary Comparison Operators when both operands are of type 'num'.


// Binary Equality Operators when both operands are of type 'num'.
